## Start Developing

To get started playing around in this app first ofcourse clone this repo. 

This web app is build using a minimal Create React App setup and is all client-side. The app directly connects to the Spotify API. 

In order to connect to the Spotify Web API you need a Client ID in your environment variables. Create one at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) for free.

For local development copy the `.env.example` into `.env` and set your `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` to your custom client ID.

After that start the same way as any Create React App.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Deploying

Want to deploy directly into a instance live on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now)? It's really easy. First we need to add your client ID into your 'secrets' environment variables in Zeit.

Then we can simply deploy `now`.

```bash
$ now secret add REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
$ now
```
